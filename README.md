Versioned Polymorphic Buffers (vpbuf) - data interchange format

Versioned Polymorphic Buffers (vpbuf) is a language and platform neutral way of serializing structured data, either as flatten messages or as a file format. Instead of being permissive about data elements, all elements (integers, strings, vectors, maps) etc are versioned.

Currently cplusplus, python, and javascript are supported using a binary wire format based on AMF3.

Please stand by for additional documentation and functional details.
